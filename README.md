## Documentation

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/sfomuseum/go-sfomuseum-geometry.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sfomuseum/go-sfomuseum-geometry)

## Important

Among the dependencies is the [gogeos](https://github.com/paulsmith/gogeos/) package which depends on the [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) C library to be present. As such it is not "portable" the same way other Go tools are.

Tests are stubbed out but not implemented yet.
