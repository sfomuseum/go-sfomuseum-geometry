# go-sfomuseum-geometry

Go package for manipulating geometries, in a SFO Museum context. 

## Important

Among the dependencies is the [gogeos](https://github.com/paulsmith/gogeos/) package which depends on the [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) C library to be present. As such it is not "portable" the same way other Go tools are.
